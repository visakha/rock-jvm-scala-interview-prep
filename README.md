# Dec 2024 - Rock the JVM is an excellent resource to learn and practice Scala | Kotlin using the functional approach

Link  https://rockthejvm.com/

## Rock the JVM provides
- clarity in thinking
- code first approach with no clutter
- etc

# Why?

because most algo that are used to solve problems are very basic in nature with confusing procedural and in-place
mutations,
with heavy use of pointers to maintain the `state and reasoning of the code flow`.

- it has its merits in optimized and efficient utilization of space and time, but that's not my goal here.

my goals are

- clarity
- least mental over head
- functional thinking and solving (not currently optimized for space and time)

## Intention of this repo
- for me, its about notes taking
- re-learn many of the scala and functional thinking
- put in the effort
